# Medical Record Generation API

This API facilitates the process of generating medical records from audio files. It accepts an audio file, transcribes it, and generates a medical record based on the transcription.

The folder `output_examples` has some result of our AI:
- `uploaded_files`: has the audio file saved.
- `transcribed_file`: has the text extracted from the audio file saved.
- `medical_record`: has the medical_record generated by the generative AI.
